Hi, my name is Paul Brannan.  I've been writing software for 30 years, and I'm still learning.

Professionally, I work in fintech, but I also write code on the side for fun.  I have an interest in optimization, just-in-time compilation, programming language theory, code beauty, and doing the impossible.

I also race in the [24 Hours of Lemons](https://24hoursoflemons.com/).  My car has been featured on [bbc.com](http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20130404-a-le-mans-for-clunkers) (the one getting pushed by the tow truck).  I also am the owner of the so-called [Race Prius](https://www.facebook.com/RacePrius), a stock, fully caged Prius which competed in two weekend-long endurance races before the battery computer went haywire.  One day, I hope to see it race again.
