  content: Wow looks nice. My question is&hellip;how to decide between llvm, libjit,
    lightning, and re-tooling psyco&ndash;which would be fastest? How to decide? I&rsquo;ll
    admit libjit looks simplest, and has a reasonably friendly license now&ndash;my
    question is basically which is fastest/best? Thanks! -=R

<p>I&#8217;m back in the country now and starting to work on Ludicrous again.  A number of YARV instructions have now been implemented and very simple methods can be executed.</p>
<p>Stack manipulation is tricky.  As mentioned before, the first pass of JIT-compiling YARV bytecode actually allocated a Ruby array for every method invocation, calling rb_ary_push() and rb_ary_pop() to manipulate the stack.  As you can imagine, this is quite slow.</p>
<p>The next pass tried to actually use the real YARV stack.  This meant directly accessing Ruby&#8217;s thread structure to get a pointer to the stack.  It was faster than using an array, but there were too many edge cases where the stack pointer wasn&#8217;t being manipulated properly.</p>
<p>The current solution uses a static stack instead of a dynamic stack, pushing and popping the stack at compile time rather than at run time.  This means that stack operations can actually be optimized into register operations.  It obviously doesn&#8217;t work with all possible YARV bytecode, but I don&#8217;t know of any cases where Ruby generates bytecode that needs a run-time stack (e.g. pushing a value onto the stack in a loop).  In any case there are some rudimentary checks for such code, e.g. that the stack size is the same at the beginning and end of a detected loop.</p>
<p>The next challenge to tackle is to implement rescue and ensure.  I&#8217;ve already got PUSH_TAG, POP_TAG, and EXEC_TAG implemented in ruby-jit (impossible on 1.8, since the current tag is private in eval.c), and the rest should come relatively easily.</p>
