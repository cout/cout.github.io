<p>A difficult and unfortunate truth for any hobbyist is that there is only so much time in a single human lifespan.  I have wanted to continue to play with <a href="http://rubystuff.org/ludicrous">JIT compilation</a>, not only because it is useful and an interesting mental challenge, but because it's a great way to disconnect from the world.  Sadly, time does not permit this to happen.</p>
<p>I hope to one day again come back to the hobbyist programming world.  It was a difficult decision this year to not attend <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> for the first time ever (until this year, I was one of four remaining nine-time attendees).    But all good things must come to an end, and ends make way for new beginnings.  In my case, new beginning include racing in the <a href="http://24hoursoflemons.com">24 Hours of Lemons</a>, building a <a href="http://turbominivan.com">minivan drag car</a>, and the possibility of entering medical school.</p>
<p>As for the minivan, I would like to make it <em>ruby-powered</em>.  K-cars (including the caravan/voyager) are really simple machines, and for a few hundred dollars, every sensor in the vehicle can be datalogged.  This is a must for building reliable power: if the engine is not running efficiently, then it's not producing as much power as it potentially could; worse yet, at high boost it could damage the motor.  (yes, you read that right -- this minivan has a <em>turbo</em>).</p>
<p>Datalogging a drag-run should be straightforward.  I've never done anything like this, so what sounds simple when I read about it may turn out to be a PITA.  But once I get the datalogger hooked up, how much fun would it be to write a ruby library to intercept the data in real-time?  And how much more fun would it be on top of that to visualize this data in real-time using an opengl frontend?  Lastly, how slick would it be to take this opengl display and project it onto the windshield ala a heads-up-display?</p>
<p>I've wanted to get back into graphics programming for quite a while; now I have an excuse.  All I need now is some spare time.</p>
