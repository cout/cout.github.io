A difficult and unfortunate truth for any hobbyist is that there is only so much time in a single human lifespan.  I have wanted to continue to play with [JIT compilation](http://rubystuff.org/ludicrous), not only because it is useful and an interesting mental challenge, but because it's a great way to disconnect from the world.  Sadly, time does not permit this to happen.

I hope to one day again come back to the hobbyist programming world.  It was a difficult decision this year to not attend [RubyConf](http://rubyconf.org/) for the first time ever (until this year, I was one of four remaining nine-time attendees).    But all good things must come to an end, and ends make way for new beginnings.  In my case, new beginning include racing in the [24 Hours of Lemons](http://24hoursoflemons.com), building a [minivan drag car](http://turbominivan.com), and the possibility of entering medical school.

As for the minivan, I would like to make it _ruby-powered_.  K-cars (including the caravan/voyager) are really simple machines, and for a few hundred dollars, every sensor in the vehicle can be datalogged.  This is a must for building reliable power: if the engine is not running efficiently, then it's not producing as much power as it potentially could; worse yet, at high boost it could damage the motor.  (yes, you read that right -- this minivan has a _turbo_).

Datalogging a drag-run should be straightforward.  I've never done anything like this, so what sounds simple when I read about it may turn out to be a PITA.  But once I get the datalogger hooked up, how much fun would it be to write a ruby library to intercept the data in real-time?  And how much more fun would it be on top of that to visualize this data in real-time using an opengl frontend?  Lastly, how slick would it be to take this opengl display and project it onto the windshield ala a heads-up-display?

I've wanted to get back into graphics programming for quite a while; now I have an excuse.  All I need now is some spare time.
